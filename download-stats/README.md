# Download Statistics
File download statistics from the package server. The raw statistics files are contained in this directory, tagged by year/month. 

### These stats do **not** account for things like: 
* Mirror sites which host ISO files
* Mirror sites which host package files

### Notes about stats
* The number of times the repository packagesite.txz file is downloaded is a good estimation of the number of systems which were installed
